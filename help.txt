SQL Migrations
All migrations are in "Migrations" folder of each project using HBGDB.
After domain model is changed, (existed Models are edited, or new models added) you have to add new Migrations for related DbContext.
To create new Migration for current DbContext state, use:
-- dotnet ef migrations add {{InitialContacts}} --context {{AppDbContext}} --output-dir Migrations
All Migrations describe changing history of database and will be applied to the database (if not yet) when starting up the API.
